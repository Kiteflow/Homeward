# Hi there :) Welcome to the Homeward config!
# Thanks so much for installing Homeward, I hope you find it useful!
# Homeward was designed to be a minimalist, customisable homes plugin
# Not to mention we're open source!

# Time to configure how you want your homes stored.
# If you are storing a lot of homes, or have access to a MySQL database, I would highly suggest using MySQL.
# Otherwise, you can just ignore this section, as Homeward can function without it!
mysql: false
host: test.com
port: 3306
username: test
password: "password"
database: test

# Here's where you set how many homes you want people to have by default
# There is a 32 home limit for anyone who hasn't got the "homeward.admin" permission.
# Home limits are set by permissions too! Just add "homeward.homes.x" with x being the home amount
defaulthomes: 1

# Any worlds you that homes shouldn't be available in should be put here
# Just remember "homeward.admin" does bypass this
disabled-worlds:
  - world_nether
  - world_the_end

# If you want a custom prefix to appear before your messages, this is what you want to use!
# If you don't want a custom prefix, or any prefix at all, just change prefixEnabled to false.
prefix: "&3[Homeward]"
prefixEnabled: true

# Here comes the messages! All messages Homeward sends to a player are configurable.

# We recommend that these be a positive color, but it's your decision!
homeCreated: "&aHome created!"
teleportedToHome: "&aTeleported to home!"

homesListTitle: "&dHomes -"

# We would recommend these be a more negative color, but again, it's customisable for a reason!
homeNameInUse: "&cHome name already in use!"
homeLimitReached: "&cHome limit reached!"
homeNotFound: "&cHome not found!"
dontOwnThisHome: "&cYou don't own this home!"
homeDeleted: "&cHome deleted!"
noHomesFound: "&cNo homes found!"
cannotSetInWorld: "&cCannot set a home in this world!"
playerNotFound: "&cPlayer not found!"
invalidFormat: "&cInvalid format!"

# Thanks for configuring Homeward! I hope it serves you well.
